# fvm

**fvm** is a Clojure library for writing self-optimizing interpreters.

## How it works

fvm provides a function called `defnode` for defining AST nodes with the following signature:

```clojure
(fvm/defnode <node-type> <opts> <handler-fn>)
```

As an example, Clojure's `def` could be implemented in the following manner:

```clojure
(fvm/defnode ::def {}
  (fn [state]
    (let [def-node (-> state ::fvm/nodes first)
          curr-ns (::curr-ns state)
          {::keys [name value]} def-node]
      (assoc-in state [curr-ns ::vars name] value))))
```

assuming that your parser had parsed the expression `(def a 1)` as:

```clojure
{::fvm/type ::def
 ::name 'a
 ::value 1}
```

## Examples

[ednlang]() is a simple stack-based concatenative language implemented using fvm.

ednlang is meant to showcase all the features of fvm, and is also used to test and profile fvm.

## Status

This is still under development and considered alpha quality till 1.0 is released.
